<p>Time to time, I give advice to my friends for the bid they would put on
Tehran Commodity Exchange (IME). The auctions are structured as follows:
there is a minimum price, fixed supply and maximum price change of 10
percent. Then the ones who put the highest price will get the commodity
at the price they demand till supply meets demand. So on average lowest
winning bit is lower than highest price.</p>

<p>The models I wrote for this matter are generally based on nth price
common value auctions and I use some model averaging on them. They
normally predict lowest bid or weighted adjusted mean bid with RMSE of
.5 percent. So on average there is a 1-2% gain in that transaction.</p>

<p>Last week, given the data, I ran the models. To my surprise for LLD209
and LD0075 shown estimates that were more than 10 percent of maximum
allowed price. The result of competition among bidders, supported the
results. Observing this, it seemed to me that the market was cornered.
Pretty beautiful thing to be witnessed. I was excited :))</p>

<p>Given the fact that it seemed that the market is cornered, I thought
about the conditioned that it could happen. My thought is considering
this thing as a game theoretic question.</p>

<p>Here are the situation that yield to market being cornered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Following Feb IRRUSD rate was surging. The price of petrochemicals
in Tehran have very high correlation to their international prices
in USD terms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commodity traders and consumers have bought considerable amounts of
LD and LLD. They tried to first enjoy the rise in the price, second
avoid buying at higher expected prices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During third week of March to 1st week of April, consumers of LLD
and LD are at national new year holidays and subsequently demand for
LD and LLD reduces to lowest amount. So most of the inventory of LLD
and LD remain the same.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And the last and most crucial one. While till third week of April
IRRUSD was around 49000, the government banned the transactions and
reduced the price to 42000. As a result most of the traders of LD
and LLD faced substantial losses.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="set-up">set up</h2>

<p>Since this is just for my curiosity, I try to simplify the solutions and
try to be concise.</p>

<p>As I observed, there is an strictly dominant strategy for players. They
are N players, of which k are doing speculative trades. Due to lack of
productions in previous weeks of auctions I simplify and assume that N
is equal to k. Each player has three choices, do not increase the bid
from base price, bid at average increase rate, and bid the maximum
available amount. ( Actually as I said before I consider bidding as nth
price common value auction, I try to not make things more complicated
than necessary).Based on market price and demand of bidders the player
decides on his/her choice. Generally, putting the difference of market
price and auction price aside, In case of bidding at base price, demand
is less than supply. If the average winning bid increases at less than
10 percent, then demand amount of winning bid meet supply. If 10 percent
increase in average bids occur, then demand needs to be at least equal
to supply.</p>

<p>Let see summary of bids in the cases that they have increased from base
price, and let see the tail of data. The data has been subset to the
date after 2016-08-01. I saw small changes in structure around that
time, thought I have not check it with structural break tests.</p>

<p>Price of the commodity in market is loosely equal to average bid price
times 9.262 percent VAT and omissions, plus the amount they pay to the
people who has the right to buy at exchange( bidding is limited to the
ones who has a production facility, they get a 500IRR per kilo to let
others use their right- this is not an absolutely legal act.), plus the
amount they pay for transportation from petrochemical facilities to
Tehran which is 950 IRR in this case and finally a mark-up they add per
kilo which is loosely 1000IRR. So the prices for LLD209 and LD0075 could
be computed as follows:</p>

<p>Simplified payoff that I consider here is consisted of two part. Here I
assumed that players are identical and the amount they buy is minimum
one truckload, that is 20 tons. We also assume that there exist a total
speculative inventory “Inv” in the market and that is equally
distributed among “k” trader. First part is the amount the player pays
for reacquiring commodities, and second part is the amount of change in
value of its inventory:</p>

<p>minimum position = 20000 Kg payoff in case of bidding at base price:</p>

<p>−(<em>P<strong>b</strong>c</em> − <em>m<strong>r</strong>k<strong>u</strong>p</em>)*20000 + <em>P<strong>b</strong>c</em> * <em>I<strong>n</strong>v</em>/<em>k</em> − <em>P</em>.<em>p<strong>r</strong>v</em>.<em>a<strong>u</strong>c</em> * <em>I<strong>n</strong>v</em>/<em>k</em></p>

<p><em>s</em>.*t. : k x  20 &lt;= supply</p>

<p>payoff in case of an increase in bid equal to average increase:</p>

<p>−(<em>Pc</em> − <em>m<strong>r</strong>k<strong>u</strong>p</em>)*20000 + <em>Pc</em> * <em>I<strong>n</strong>v</em>/<em>k</em> − <em>P</em>.<em>p<strong>r</strong>v</em>.<em>a<strong>u</strong>c</em> * <em>I<strong>n</strong>v</em>/<em>k</em></p>

<p><em>s</em>.*t. : k x  20 = supply</p>

<p>payoff in case of bidding at maximum available price:</p>

<p>−(<em>P<strong>c</strong>or</em> − <em>m<strong>r</strong>k<strong>u</strong>p</em>) x (<em>s<strong>u</strong>p<strong>p</strong>ly</em>/<em>k</em> x  20000) x 20000  +<em>P<strong>c</strong>or</em> x<em> </em>I<strong>n</strong>v<em>/</em>k<em> − </em>P<em>.</em>p<strong>r</strong>v<em>.</em>a<strong>u</strong>c<em> x </em>I<strong>n</strong>v<em>/</em>k</p>

<p>The last payoff, takes the fact that in case of equal bids, the supply
would be divided equally to bidders into account. As we will see this
ratio has a enormous effect on the cost of cornering market.</p>

<p>For having a strictly dominant strategy, the second payoff should be
strictly larger than first one. Also the third term should be strictly
larger than second term.</p>

<p><em>I<strong>n</strong>v</em>/<em>k</em> &gt; ((<em>Pc</em> − <em>P<strong>b</strong>c</em>)*20000)/(<em>Pc</em> − <em>P<strong>b</strong>c</em>)</p>

<p><em>I<strong>n</strong>v</em>/<em>k</em> &gt; ( − (<em>Pc</em> − <em>m<strong>r</strong>k<strong>u</strong>p</em>)*20000 + (<em>P<strong>c</strong>or</em> − <em>m<strong>r</strong>k<strong>u</strong>p</em>)*(<em>s<strong>u</strong>p<strong>p</strong>ly</em>/20000 * <em>k</em>)*20000)/(<em>P<strong>c</strong>or</em> − <em>Pc</em>)</p>

<p>The first inequality reduces to Inv/k being bigger than minimum position
which is 20 Tons.</p>

<p>If we neglect the mark-up term, the second inequality would be:</p>

<p><em>I<strong>n</strong>v</em>/<em>k</em> &gt; 20000 * (<em>P<strong>c</strong>or</em> * (<em>s<strong>u</strong>p<strong>p</strong>ly</em>/<em>k</em> * 20000)) − <em>Pc</em>)/(<em>P<strong>c</strong>or</em> − <em>Pc</em>)</p>

<p>It means if the supply over aggregate demand being low enough, then the
inequality is holding even for very small per player inventory. In other
words, in this design and by these assumption, market will be cornered.</p>

<p>Let see what is the amount of minimum per player inventory given the
data:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Minimum per trader position for LLD209 in order that 2nd inequality holds

<p>Oh, these are pretty fascinating results :))</p>

<p>Given the data, strictly dominant strategy will be choosen.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It seems that under special circumstances that total speculative
inventory is high enough, decision to cornering market is strictly
dominant strategy, regardless of previous price.</p>

<p>If inventories of speculative traders meet above criterion there is
incentive to bid at highest available price. So by the time that
inventories get consumed for producing products, cornering the market
could continue. A decrease in prices due to importing of commodities
from gulf countries could change the assumptions, yet giveno new
regulations in Forex market, it does not seem to happen.</p>
