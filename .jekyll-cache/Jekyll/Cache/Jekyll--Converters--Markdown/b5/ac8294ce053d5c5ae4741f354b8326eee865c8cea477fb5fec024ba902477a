<p>I have tried to obtain cash flow and balance sheet data from
<a href="http://www.tsetmc.com">tsetmc.com</a>. It was not as straightforward as I
thought. Here is what I encountered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Easy parts:
    <ul>
      <li>Each stock has a unique number at the at the end of address</li>
      <li>Mutual funds and delisted and trade-able stocks have different
structure than others</li>
      <li>Numbers are in English and not Persian</li>
      <li>Balance sheets and Cash flow data have separate pages that has
no unique addresses and need to be clicked on</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Troublesome parts:
    <ul>
      <li>Different years balance sheets and cash flow data have no
special ‚Äúid‚Äù or ‚Äúname‚Äù or anything else that would make it easy
to separate them</li>
      <li>data for different years are just separable by text part</li>
      <li>With R I could not use regex on the text and separate different
fields automatically</li>
      <li>It seems that the site uses some Arabic characters instead of
Persian for some sounds like ‚Äúii‚Äù</li>
      <li>there is no unique pattern for balance sheet or cash flow data,
it seemed to me that they could be distinguished only by using
regex</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>By seeing these I reached to the conclusion that since regex with partly
Persian character and partly Arabic is not possible in R- by my
knowledge- so I would use just the data that have unique path. I used
RSelenium for web scrapping but since I would not click on the pages or
fill forms, RSelenium is not necessary. The some of the data that have
unique path included: Book value of outstanding stocks, free float rate,
MCap, EPS, P/E and groups P/E. The last one as I said before and
considering the kind of group separation that is used is almost useless
yet I get it in order to see whether it has any value that I am
neglecting. These data seemed to me to be more than enough for splitting
the stocks by small vs big criteria.</p>

<p>The URL for each stock is like this:
‚Äú<a href="http://www.tsetmc.com/Loader.aspx?ParTree=151311&amp;i=42354736493447489">http://www.tsetmc.com/Loader.aspx?ParTree=151311&amp;i=42354736493447489</a>‚Äù
which has two part the part before equal sign is common part for
different stocks and the number after that is unique to each stock.</p>

<p>I used Docker for Selenium server on Firefox.</p>

<p>The first if statement checks whether the id is for a mutual fund or not
and the second one checks whether the stock is delisted or not.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>By making a list of the ids for URL I made a data frame of some
fundamental data. Using that in next post I would consider momentum
strategy. Please let me know if you have a find a good way for regex in
R or any other language that could be used for getting data from
tsetmc.com, I would deeply appreciate it.</p>
