Intro
-----

This year's macroeconomics and investment environments were similar to
the previous year's environments. Substantial increase in price levels,
high variance of prices, and outstanding geopolitical risks were
prevalent. While raw material and refinery export improved compared to
the last years, in terms of quantity it was less than their long term
averages. After some changes in export procedures by the state, prices
of exported petrochemical compared to domestic ones increased and and
the gap between the two narrowed. M1 and M2 continued their increase at
high rates, and M1 saw unprecedented growth values. This was partly
caused by budget deficits and, to some extent, by an increase in banks'
free reserves following slowdowns in economic activity which itself stem
from hindering measures aimed at containing the spread of Covid-19.
Stock market's surge continued and higher nominal values were recorded
for Overall Index. Yet any expectations of structural changes and
imagination that stocks will be valued by considering longer term cash
flows deemed to be in vain. Government officials invited people to
invest in stock market and the number of investors increased day by day.
At August government, social security and corporations related to
welfare ministry flooded the local stock market with stocks. Increase in
supply or a neglect over market impact effects led to a market crash.
Some of the private equity funds had perfect timing before and on the
day of the crash.

An event before market crash was a statement by 25 "concerned economist"
claiming that stock market "is the cause of the inflation", and they
"urgently demanded" that "a third of government stocks ought to be sold
immediately" and that the government could lessen the budget deficit by
that. Using back of envelop calculations and considering an average free
float of 0.2, the prescribed number was around 7 to 8 percentage of free
float of listed stocks in Tehran Stock Exchange. Some of those 25
"economist" have some nice papers in top ten journals. Given their track
records, we are still waiting for the proof of their claim that stock
market growth leads to inflation. Before and after the advised
intervention money multiplier was around 7.5 and it did not changed
afterward. Further as basic economic models says, increase in number of
transactions has negative effect on price levels, ceteris paribus.
Inflation and money supply, which a number of them assertively claimed
that it is strictly endogenous, increased after their advice was
implemented. This all said, I am one of the economics graduates that
still wait for their research papers on this issue. This revolutionary
idea of theirs, if proved, is as revolutionary as marginalism revolution
in economics. But I wonder how they are going to prove that inflation is
not a monetary phenomenon and it is a stock market phenomenon :D I wish
them lots of luck for doing the impossible :)

During the performance analysis period, geopolitical risks heightened.
USA presidential elections and subsequent change in expectations of
future sanction environment was an added uncertainty. mentioned risks
and uncertainties, stock market crash, and signs of a stagnant real
state market resulted in a 70 percent increase in check-able and
redeemable accounts amount in November. This is while inflation was 30.5
percent and saving deposit amount growth was less than 2 percent
(numbers are on a 12 month basis, November 2020 compared to November 2021. The numbers for EOY of Iranian calender, 3rd week of March, was
68.6 percent for check-able accounts, 56.6 percent for redeemable
accounts, 43 percent for short term saving deposits and negative growth
for long term saving deposits, and inflation was 36.2 percent. These
changes are in line with the stated conclusion). Talks about lifting
sanction with new USA administration began in January and it is still
ongoing. After mid-February very strict price limits laws were
introduced. Presumably so the newly appointed chief of local Stock
Exchange could buy time for decision making by himself and in hope of
good news. Which in action eroded market liquidity.

Canceled plans for relocation and the profit opportunity, led me to
raise capital for the portfolio. Seeing the imminent crash, I cashed in
6/10 of the equity holding. Predicting the market will fall, and given
that the local market almost just has a buy-side, I traded much less and
devoted my time to studying for GRE and IELTS exams. There was a
possibility of buying put options on some stocks. Those options are
neither liquid assets nor most of their writers were institutional. I
read that option writers had problems depositing adjusted option margins
in August. Hence, I forgo buying put options.

All in all, the structural change that I hoped for did not happen.
Secondly, pension funds where better off by selling assets at higher
prices.

Lets take a look at performance metrics for this period.

### Charts and measurements

#### Charts: Indices

For comparison I used four of the indexes that are provided by Tehran
Stock Exchange. Concise definition of them are:

-   Total Equal weight Pr: Based on prices of listed stocks. Equal
    weight is given to prices.

-   Overall Index: Based on market cap weighted adjusted prices of
    listed stocks, dividends and IPOs are included.

-   Top 30 Index: Only includes 30 biggest companies.

-   Top 50 Index: Only includes 30 biggest companies.

Last two indices have survivorship bias. Due to some local market rules,
some stocks are closed for trading for specific predefined or unspecific
predefined time :) For example after disclosing information, or a fifty
percent increase/ decrease in stock price, or reevaluations, they are
closed for trading. Being closed for trading could last from several
days to a more than a year. Since these indexes are calculated using
latest available price, Indices have slightly undervalued variance
compared to
[VLGI](https://phoebuslyubil.github.io/2017-02-05-Benchmark-and-Prediction-Part-I/).
Market cap weighted indices include IPOs from day one of their offering.
As a result big cap IPOs strongly influence them. Further the Overall
Index, the main Index, includes dividends. IPO of the main fund of
Social Security was significant for this Index.

![](../img/Performance 2020-2021\Index Performance.png)

Last year's observation, [divergance between drift term of small and big
stocks](https://phoebuslyubil.github.io/2020-07-15-Performance-analysis-2018-04-05-to-2020-04-05/)
, continued till mid August. From mid July till mid August, as I
mentioned above, around 7-8% of free float of all stocks was sold by big
funds, government and welfare ministry subordinates including main fund
of Social Security. Main social security fund itself had an IPO in which
it offered 10 percent of its existing shares. Since I think social
security is based on trust of payers and its main duty is notoriety of
investing borrowed money and reducing payers cautionary savings by law
of large numbers, I did not consider this an appropriate action. Yet it
was done. It's price 7.6 folded. Main Social Security fund sold 2 more
percent of its stocks at higher values and then, as with many other
stocks especially big cap ones, its share price sank to 28 percent its
highest value.

For comparison purposes and reducing the effects of survivorship bias,
the graph presents both the Top 50 Index and Top 30 Index. While
starting point and drawdawns of these two indices and Overall Index are
almost similar, cumulative returns of Top 50 Index, Overall Index, and
Equal weight price index converge to an approximately similar final
value. That is to say, some companies did not remain in top 30 market
cap list and moved to top 50 one. Having in mind that most of top 30 cap
stocks were state related stocks in beginning of the analysis period
plus looking at Top 50 Index cumulative returns compared with Top 30
Index, some traders have imagined a case of pump it and dump it. I
refrain from this deduction. I mostly think it was the suggestion by
those so called "25 concerned economist" that resulted in the crash.
Mass selling by entangled institutions was right after their suggestion
and the amount of sold stocks matched their prescribed amount. As I said
before, I am still waiting for their paper in a reputable journal
proving their novel idea that inflation is a stock market phenomenon and
not a monetary one :) Who can resist reading such a revolutionary
research? :) So much against common sense that even in my wildest
imaginations I can never imagine it would even be written what about
being published by "25 concerned economist" :D A dark humor is that this
kind of advice is common in Tehran academic institutions and no one was
ever held responsible for these kind of claims. I hope one day I see the
end of self seeking polemics.

Indexes have almost reached to a steady state from mid January.
Afterward, as with most other drawdowns, relative price adjustments have
begun. It was as I imagined until local stock exchange chief was
changed. He introduced +6/-2 percent price limits on daily trading. In
local market trades are prioritized based on arrival time of orders.
After a few days people who wanted to sell had difficulties selling
their stocks. Race to transmit sell limit orders at higher speed at
stock market opening began. Liquidity nearly vanished to an extent that
on some days aggregate stock market trading volume reached to a
twentieth of its value in summer. Market halted and prices fell slowly,
but steadily. Although, by new US government attitude toward sanctions
and considerable reduction in geopolitical risks stock prices were
expected to increase, new price limit rules hindered any foreseeable
gains. Contemporaneousness of these two event makes quantitative
evaluations of the former effect by using only stock market data very
hard.

Another mentionable occurrence was giving rights to sell redistributed
stocks in 2006. This farther the sell side pressures in July. Rights to
sell was exercised by brokers as investor agents. Most stock price
reversals before February was shortly followed by an increase in sell
side. At such instances, news about redistributed stocks were usually
released after market hours. Due to lack of public data in my hands, I
cannot quantify this matter. This data plus data about algos would be
pretty informative about continuation of falling prices. While algos
could not submit an order after July, they had access to data. Over
several occasions, four times, I saw reductions in listed stock prices
at almost the same time and much faster than human reaction. In all of
those four cases, a slight decrease in demand for one of top 30 cap
index was the trigger and massive orders to dump stocks happened in less
than 4 minutes. Given that algos are newly introduced to the domestic
market, similarity between their strategies and hence their outcome is
not a unprecedented occurrence. Anyway, these hypothesizes need data to
be more than guesses.

#### Charts: Portfolio

As the chart shows, equity part of the portfolio performed better than
Overall Index and Top 30 Index. [negative
correlation](https://phoebuslyubil.github.io/2017-02-12-Hedging-Against-External-Factors/)
between foreign exchange component of the portfolio and indexes
conditional on external risks seems to reduced overall variation in the
portfolio. At the stock market peak, I cashed around six-tenth of the
equity part of the portfolio. The cash plus foreign exchange component
of the portfolio are the reason that whole portfolio has lower variation
than indices. This reduced the drawdown and Total Portfolio has lower
drawdown than the indices.

#### Metrics

Performance metrics for the first period shows a Sharp ratio of 4.86.
Standard errors are as intended and combining foreign exchange and
equities reduced SE in portfolio to a lower level than Overall Index.
Return is around a forth larger than return of Total Equal Weight Price
Index.

Sharp ratio, Information ratio and max drawdawn of portfolio are
satisfactory compared to indices.I am happy about them :)

Information ratios of indices are also reported. It was not a necessary
or an informative act, yet I find the differences interesting. Maybe I
make a measure based on them.

Conclusion
----------

Based on last year conclusion I stopped looking at just annualized Sharp
ratio and be happy when it is above two. Standard deviation, Information
ratio and Sharp ratio when considered together and calculated by using
rolling time windows seem to result better measure of performance at
each point. I think that this is still not an optimal performance
measure at each point and I feel that it needs to be enhanced.

Another fact that I learned is the importance of increasing assets under
management. I have done it and quantified results showed me that it is
not in any way less important than other factors like timing, analysis,
prospect of assets, risk management, performance analysis, frequency of
trading, leverage and network.

Having my GRE and IELTS results, it is probable that I will study
Corporate Finance MSc in coming academic year. If Covid-19 situation
makes this improbable, then a company will be born :)
