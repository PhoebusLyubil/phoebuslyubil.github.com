I decided to save a part of my income in order to build a garden in a place with Mediterranean weather. To do so I need to make investments with my retirement account. I would write about the steps related to that and their required data analysis here.
<br>
Currently I do most of my analysis with R. In future maybe I would migrate to Julia. Since I am residing in Tehran, I have no access to international stock exchanges. As a result for the time being most of the analysis would be about Tehran Stock Exchange and foreign exchanges with Rial as denominator. if I work in a full time position, I would spend six hours per week on managing my retirement account and post here, yet for the time being I have much more free time.
<br>
Time to time I would post some of my oil painting here too. I paint a few per year, and normally just a few persons like them, but I do paint them anyway ;) needless to say I am not an expert, it is a hobby of mine.
<br>
I hope that with your precious feedback I would be able to enhance my performance. Anyway this is a blog for turning the garden from fancy to reality in 30 years :)
